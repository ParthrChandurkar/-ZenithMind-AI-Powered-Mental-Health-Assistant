# 🧠 ZenithMind — AI-Powered Mental Health Assistant

> A full-stack digital mental wellness ecosystem combining **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**, **AI-driven mood analytics**, and **gamified self-care** — built for students and young professionals.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Mental health challenges like stress, anxiety, insomnia and disrupted sleep have become increasingly prevalent among college students and early-career professionals. Existing wellness apps address these in isolation — some focus only on meditation (Headspace, Calm), others only on chatbot conversations (Woebot, Wysa). None bring it all together.

**ZenithMind bridges that gap.** It is a modular, AI-informed mental health platform that combines structured CBT techniques, real-time mood tracking, physical health data (via Google Fit), and gamified engagement — all under one cohesive interface. Built on the MERN stack with a CBT-powered AI chatbot at its core, ZenithMind aims to democratize mental wellness support in an accessible, private, and always-available format.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered CBT Chatbot** — 24/7 NLP-enabled chatbot applying cognitive restructuring, thought reframing, and coping strategies in real conversation
- 📊 **Mood & Stress Analytics Dashboard** — daily mood logs visualized as line graphs, pie charts, and weekly trends for long-term self-awareness
- 🏃 **Google Fit Integration** — correlates physical metrics (steps, heart rate, sleep cycles) with mental states for data-driven wellness recommendations
- 🎮 **Gamified Habit Engine** — streaks, badges, and achievement milestones to reinforce positive mental health habits
- 🩺 **Therapist & Admin Panel** — role-based dashboards for counselors and institutions to monitor anonymized group well-being trends
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** — JWT-based login with role assignment (User / Admin / Therapist)
- 📈 **Progress Reflection** — analytics-driven growth charts help users track emotional improvement over time

## 🏗️ System Architecture

ZenithMind uses a modular **MERN stack** architecture with a React client, Express API, MongoDB persistence, realtime community messaging, and wellness integrations.

| Layer | Responsibility | Key modules |
|---|---|---|
| React Client | User, therapist, and admin interfaces with protected route access | `src/App.js`, dashboards, chatbot, trackers, games, therapist booking |
| API Gateway | Express server, security middleware, CORS, request parsing, route mounting | `server/server.js` |
| Authentication & Roles | JWT-based sessions with user, therapist, and admin role gates | `auth.routes.js`, `admin.auth.routes.js`, `therapist.auth.routes.js`, `middleware/auth.js` |
| Wellness Services | Mood, sleep, stress, activity, nutrition, exercises, reports, and game scores | `server/src/routes/*`, `server/src/controllers/*` |
| AI Layer | Gemini-powered wellness analysis and CBT-style chat/reflection support | `/api/ai`, `/api/ai/gemini`, `server/src/routes/ai.routes.js` |
| Realtime Community | Socket.IO group rooms, live messages, and online user counts | Socket handlers in `server/server.js` |
| Data Layer | MongoDB/Mongoose models for users, logs, appointments, chat sessions, tokens, and scores | `server/src/models/*` |
| External Integrations | Google Fit health data and Zoom meeting links for therapist sessions | `googlefit.routes.js`, `services/zoom.js` |

Primary data flow: the React app sends authenticated REST requests to Express; Express validates identity and routes each request to the relevant controller/service; MongoDB stores app state and longitudinal wellness data; Gemini, Google Fit, and Zoom are called only through backend-managed API layers; Socket.IO handles realtime community updates alongside the REST workflow.

## 🧠 CBT Techniques Implemented

ZenithMind operationalizes evidence-based CBT techniques digitally:

**Cognitive Restructuring** — the chatbot guides users through identifying negative automatic thoughts and gradually reframing them toward rational viewpoints through structured questioning.

**Structured Journaling** — mood logging follows a semi-automated CBT thought-record format, capturing triggers, thoughts, and emotional reactions to build pattern awareness over time.

**Behavioral Activation** — when mood trends and activity indicators signal avoidance behaviors, the system suggests small, achievable actions (e.g. a 15-minute walk, a breathing session) to reinforce positive routines.

**Emotional Labeling** — users categorize their emotional states, building literacy in connecting mental health patterns to lifestyle factors like sleep and activity.

## 🔬 Comparative Analysis

ZenithMind was benchmarked against leading mental health apps across 10 core feature dimensions:

| Feature | ZenithMind | Headspace | Woebot | Wysa | Calm | Replika |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CBT Chatbot | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Mood Analytics Dashboard | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Google Fit / Wearable Integration | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Gamified Engagement | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Therapist Panel Access | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Google Fit integration depends on third-party API reliability — delays can affect real-time insights
- Mood entries are self-reported, introducing subjectivity in data accuracy
- The CBT chatbot is a guided support tool, **not a replacement** for clinical diagnosis or treatment in severe cases
- Recommendations deepen as more behavioral data accumulates — early-use suggestions may be less personalized
- Continuous operation requires stable internet access and device permissions for Google Fit data sync

---

## 🔭 Future Work

- 🎙️ **Voice therapy module** — spoken CBT sessions using speech-to-text
- 📡 **Passive stress prediction** — ML models on wearable signals without active user input
- 🌍 **Multilingual & cultural localization** — adapting to Indian academic and corporate contexts
- 🏥 **Certified therapist dashboards** — expanding clinical integration and validation
- 📏 **Longitudinal clinical trials** — statistically rigorous validation with larger, diverse populations
